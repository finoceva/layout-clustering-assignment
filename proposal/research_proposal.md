# Layout Clustering and Quality Improvement: Research Proposal

## Brief Explanation of Approach

This project addresses layout clustering through a two-track methodology that separates structural similarity from quality-based similarity. Our implementation combines statistical analysis, pre-trained language models, and vision language models to create a system for layout analysis and improvement.

### Core Problem: Layout Clustering and Similarity Metrics

Layout clustering requires understanding two distinct types of similarity:

1. **Structural Similarity**: How layouts are organized visually (element arrangement, spatial relationships)
2. **Quality Similarity**: What makes layouts effective or ineffective (alignment, balance, spacing)

### Implemented Solution

**Track 1: Structural Clustering**
- Uses LayoutLMv3 embeddings (768-dimension vectors) to capture layout structure
- Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction (optimal: 10 components)
- Clusters with KMeans (optimal: 2-8 clusters depending on data)
- Achieves 0.6099 silhouette score on real layout data

**Track 2: Quality Analysis**
- Extracts geometric features (alignment, balance, spacing, density)
- Performs statistical analysis (t-tests) to identify quality differentiators
- Generates interpretable recommendations based on significant features

**Track 3: VLM-Powered Improvement**
- Uses vision language models to generate improved layout coordinates
- Creates actual before/after visualizations rather than text descriptions

## Research Proposal

### 1. AI/ML Approaches for Layout Clustering

#### Current Methods
- **Pre-trained Models**: LayoutLMv3, LayoutLMv1 for structural understanding
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (optimal for speed), UMAP (better for non-linear relationships)
- **Clustering**: KMeans (balanced performance), HDBSCAN (automatic cluster detection)
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests for feature significance, Cohen's d for effect size

#### Recommended Approaches
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Naturally model layout element relationships
- **Contrastive Learning**: Learn embeddings that separate quality levels
- **Multi-task Learning**: Joint training for clustering and quality prediction
- **Vision Transformers**: Fine-tuned on layout images for end-to-end learning

### 2. Data Requirements

#### Current Dataset Limitations
- Only 90 layouts (insufficient for deep learning)
- Binary quality labels (pass/fail) lack nuance
- Limited design domains represented

#### Proposed Data Collection Strategy

**Public Datasets**
- **Crello/Canva Templates**: 100K+ layouts with engagement metrics
- **Magazine Layout Dataset**: Print designs with typography focus

**Synthetic Data Generation**
- Programmatically generate layouts with controlled quality variations
- Use existing templates with systematic modifications
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, scaling, color changes)

**Crowdsourced Annotation**
- Collect 5-point quality ratings instead of binary labels
- Gather specific feedback on alignment, balance, hierarchy
- Use comparative ranking for relative quality assessment

**Target Dataset Size**: 10K-100K layouts with multi-dimensional quality labels

### 3. Main Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Limited Training Data
**Solution**:
- Start with pre-trained models (LayoutLMv3) and fine-tune
- Use transfer learning from similar domains (web design, document layout)
- Generate synthetic training data with quality variations

#### Challenge 2: Mismatch Between Design Principles and Quality Labels
**Problem**: We used LLM to generate quantitative rule functions based on Adobe's aesthetic design principles, but these established design guidelines did not align well with the quality labels in our 90 layout dataset. This reveals a fundamental disconnect between traditional aesthetic theory and the functional quality criteria used in this dataset.

**Solution**:
- Use data-driven approaches to identify quality patterns specific to the dataset
- Combine multiple evaluation methods (statistical analysis, human annotation, domain expertise)
- Validate quality metrics against actual performance rather than theoretical frameworks

#### Challenge 3: High-Dimensional Feature Space
**Solution**:
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques validated in our experiments
- Apply feature selection based on statistical significance
- Implement multi-level representations (element, group, layout)

#### Challenge 4: Real-time Performance Requirements
**Solution**:
- Optimize model architecture for inference speed
- Use efficient embedding extraction
- Implement caching for similar layout patterns

# Core clustering pipeline
def run_layout_clustering(layouts, config):
    """Main clustering pipeline with configurable methods."""
    # Extract embeddings

    embeddings = embedder.extract_batch(layouts)

    """Statistical analysis of quality factors."""
    features = extract_geometric_features(layouts)
    quality_factors = identify_significant_features(features)
    return generate_improvement_recommendations(quality_factors)

# VLM improvement system

    """Use VLM to create improved layout coordinates."""
    prompt = create_improvement_prompt(layout, quality_issues)
    improved_coords = call_vlm(prompt, layout_image)
    return create_improved_layout(layout, improved_coords)
```

### Research Directions for Development

1. **Fine-tune on Crello Dataset**: Adapt LayoutLMv3 to specific design domains
2. **Multi-label Quality Prediction**: Train models to predict specific quality aspects
3. **Active Learning Pipeline**: Efficiently collect high-value training labels
