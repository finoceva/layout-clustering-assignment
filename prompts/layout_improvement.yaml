  ## TASK
  Provide a specific, actionable recommendation to improve this layout's {feature_name}.
  Focus on concrete spatial adjustments, element positioning, or sizing changes that the designer can implement immediately.

  ## REQUIREMENTS
  1. **Be Specific**: Give exact positioning, sizing, or spacing suggestions
  2. **Be Practical**: Ensure recommendations are implementable with basic design tools
  3. **Reference the Data**: Use the current layout structure in your analysis
  4. **Focus on Impact**: Prioritize changes that will have the greatest visual improvement
  5. **Avoid Tool Mentions**: Don't suggest specific design software or tools
  6. **Be Concise**: Keep recommendations clear and actionable (2-3 sentences max)

# Feature-specific improvement strategies
feature_strategies:
  edge_alignment_score:
    common_issues: |
      - Elements positioned arbitrarily without alignment to common edges
      - Lack of invisible grid structure
      - Mixed alignment patterns creating visual chaos
    spatial_adjustments: |
      - Align element edges to create visual columns/rows
      - Establish consistent left/right margins for text elements
      - Use element edges as guides for positioning other elements
    expected_impact: |
      - Creates visual order and professionalism
      - Improves scanning efficiency
      - Reduces cognitive load for viewers

  balance_score:
    common_issues: |
      - Visual weight concentrated on one side of the layout
      - Large elements overwhelming smaller content
      - Uneven distribution creating instability
    spatial_adjustments: |
      - Move heavier elements closer to center
      - Distribute large elements across left/right sides
      - Use white space to balance dense content areas
    expected_impact: |
      - Creates visual stability and harmony
      - Improves overall aesthetic appeal
      - Guides eye movement naturally through content

  reading_flow_score:
    common_issues: |
      - Elements break natural top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading pattern
      - Important content placed in unexpected locations
      - Conflicting visual hierarchies disrupting flow
    spatial_adjustments: |
      - Position primary content in top-left region
      - Arrange elements to follow Z-pattern or F-pattern
      - Ensure logical progression from headers to body content
    expected_impact: |
      - Improves content comprehension
      - Reduces user confusion and scanning time
      - Increases engagement with content

  whitespace_ratio:
    common_issues: |
      - Content cramped together reducing readability
      - Insufficient breathing room around elements
      - Poor content-to-space ratio
    spatial_adjustments: |
      - Increase margins between elements
      - Add padding around text blocks
      - Consider removing or consolidating less important elements
    expected_impact: |
      - Improves readability and focus
      - Creates premium, professional appearance
      - Reduces visual overwhelm

  size_hierarchy:
    common_issues: |
      - Similar element sizes creating flat visual hierarchy
      - Most important content not sufficiently emphasized
      - Lack of clear entry point for viewers
    spatial_adjustments: |
      - Increase size of primary headline/focal element
      - Create clear size relationships between content levels
      - Ensure supporting elements are appropriately smaller
    expected_impact: |
      - Establishes clear information hierarchy
      - Guides attention to most important content first
      - Improves content prioritization and comprehension
